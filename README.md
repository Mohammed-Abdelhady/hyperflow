![28-second real run: plan triages the request, an analyst writes the spec, three parallel workers build under a batch reviewer, a final integration reviewer signs off](docs/assets/demo.gif)

<p align="center">
  <em>A real run: <code>plan</code> → 3 parallel workers → batch review → integration review — in 28 seconds.
  Full walkthrough on the <a href="https://mohammed-abdelhady.github.io/hyperflow/">landing site</a>.</em>

## From issue to reviewed PR

```text
/hyperflow:issue https://github.com/you/app/issues/42
```

Triage classifies the thread (bug → root-cause discipline, feature → the plan chain, question → a drafted reply).
A spec is synthesized from the issue's own acceptance criteria — issue text is treated as **data, never instructions**.
Then the standard chain runs: plan → parallel dispatch under review → a gated PR exit that opens the pull request with `Closes #42`.

The maintainer side is `/hyperflow:pr <url>` — the same L1–L5 audit over the PR's **real fetched code** (never just diff text),
findings posted as one batched review (inline, summary, or local-only), a fix chain on NEEDS_FIX, and a merge that is always gated.
Contributor code is analyzed statically, never executed.

## Quick start

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Mohammed-Abdelhady/hyperflow
claude plugin install hyperflow@hyperflow-marketplace
```

Codex App/CLI:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Mohammed-Abdelhady/hyperflow
codex plugin add hyperflow@hyperflow-marketplace
```

Initialize the project once, then invoke any skill:

```text
/hyperflow:scaffold                                        # first: set up the project (once per repo)
/hyperflow:issue https://github.com/you/app/issues/42      # issue → triage → plan → dispatch → gated PR
/hyperflow:plan "add user auth with login + middleware"    # sharpen → design → decompose → dispatch
/hyperflow:workflow "large migration across the repo"      # big-task workflow lane
/hyperflow:trace "tests fail after the auth refactor"      # root-cause a bug
/hyperflow:deploy                                          # pre-push gates + ship
```

Auto-routing is on by default — say "audit the diff" or "debug this test" and the right skill runs without the
`/hyperflow:*` prefix. In Codex, `hyperflow <skill>` is the portable spelling. Setup and host notes → [Installation](docs/installation.md).

Hyperflow uses **lean mode by default**: it loads only the context needed for the current phase. Pass `mode=default`
or `--thorough` when you explicitly want the full-context, full-ceremony path.

## What makes it different

- **Review matches the path.** The normal orchestrated path keeps Worker → Reviewer at every granularity, plus a final
  integration pass. Deterministic inline-fast work uses a foreground diff review because no worker is dispatched.
- **Memory that's yours.** Learnings, decisions, and pitfalls persist in `.hyperflow/memory/` — plain markdown, committed
  with your repo, never uploaded, never mixed across projects.
- **Depth that adapts.** A deterministic preflight admits inline-fast only after observing a clear, reversible change
  in exactly 1–2 ordinary files. Gated, generated, or migration surfaces — and every uncertain task — keep the normal
  heavyweight path. Hard ceilings stop profiles at 10k–200k tokens.

## How it works

Invoke a skill. Chain-starters auto-advance through the rest — no always-on orchestrator, no background process,
everything in your terminal, every agent on your current session model.

| # | Skill | What it does |
|---|-------|--------------|
| 1 | `issue` | **GitHub front door** — issue URL → triage → spec from the issue's own acceptance criteria → the chain, with a gated PR exit |
| 1 | `plan` | **Front door** — sharpen the prompt, design the approach (refuses to code before you approve), decompose into a parallel task graph with a test-complete brief per sub-task; stops at a build-location gate |
| 2 | `dispatch` | Fan out persona-stitched workers under per-batch + final-integration review |
| 3 | `workflow` | Big-task lane — native Claude Code dynamic workflows; a portable adapter on Codex, OpenCode, and Grok |
| 4 | `audit` | L1–L5 review on the result |
| 5 | `deploy` | Pre-push gates (lint · typecheck · build · tests · security) → commit → release → push |

`audit` and `deploy` are gates — they fire only on your explicit yes. `scaffold` is a one-time project setup.

| Role | Does |
|------|------|
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinate workers, sequence dispatches, manage chain state |
| **Decision agent** | Triage, brainstorm, decide, review every output, run the final integration pass |
| **Worker** | Execute in parallel — implement, search, write |

Triage assigns every task a flow profile, so effort matches the work instead of always running deep:

| Profile | Use when | Workers | Budget |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| `fast` | observed clear, reversible 1–2-file change outside gated/generated/migration surfaces | foreground (0 dispatched) | 10k hard |
| `standard` | simple/moderate, 2–5 files | 1–2 | 50k hard |
| `deep` | complex / cross-cutting / system-wide | 3+ | 200k hard |
| `research` | unknown territory, evaluation | 3+ searchers | 60k hard |
| `creative` | UI/UX exploration | 1–2 | 100k hard |
| `scientific` | correctness-critical, proof work | 2–3 + TDD | 200k hard |

Normal orchestrated runs record a metadata-only usage ledger: phase totals, duplicate-context ratio, retry cost,
cache-hit rate, accepted commits, tokens per accepted commit, and estimated-record count. It stores no prompts,
responses, file contents, patches, or secrets. Inline-fast dispatches zero agents, so it creates no ledger records.

Workers are stitched with the right subset of **15 composable expert personas** (architect, api, db, frontend, ui,
security, performance, scientific, refactor, bugfix, test, research, creative, devops, docs) — `security` frames every
decision first, `creative` adapts last.

Non-inline small work becomes a flat task file (`.hyperflow/tasks/<slug>.md`); work with sequential stages becomes a **feature**
with phase sub-folders, each carrying its own tasks, spec, research, and decisions — see
[`skills/hyperflow/feature-phases.md`](skills/hyperflow/feature-phases.md). A chain can also run across **two sessions**:
plan here, build in another environment via a git-committed handoff package, review back here — see
[`skills/hyperflow/session-handoff.md`](skills/hyperflow/session-handoff.md).

## 22 specialists, routed by a Brain

Reviews and investigations are run by **named domain specialists** ([`agents/`](agents/)), not a generic reviewer.
A decision-agent router — the **Brain** — is consulted once after triage, decides which specialists own the task,
and writes that roster into the artefact so the whole chain inherits it.

| Reviewers | Design-time agents | Investigators |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| `frontend-reviewer` · `backend-reviewer` · `api-reviewer` | `architect` — boundaries, data flow, frontend at scale | `searcher` — maps the codebase |
| `database-reviewer` · `database-optimization-reviewer` | `designer` — design system, prior art, anti-slop | `debugger` — 5-Whys root cause |
| `security-reviewer` · `vulnerability-reviewer` · `compliance-reviewer` | `motion` — 60fps budget, springs, reduced-motion | `analyst` — multi-dimensional analysis |
| `performance-reviewer` · `algorithm-reviewer` · `devops-reviewer` | `mobile` — RN/Flutter/native, platform a11y | `researcher` — external evidence |
| `accessibility-reviewer` · `data-ml-reviewer` | *(design at plan time, review on change)* | |

Specialists are **web-research-first**: on deep/research/scientific/security flows they look up current best practices,
CVEs, and framework docs before judging. Any agent can consult a peer mid-task via a brokered `CONSULT` signal —
see [`skills/hyperflow/consultation.md`](skills/hyperflow/consultation.md).

## Memory that persists

Learnings live at `.hyperflow/memory/` — plain markdown, committed with your repo, **never uploaded, never mixed across projects**.

- **Three tiers** — `hot` (≤7 days, always injected), `warm` (8–30 days, tag-matched), `cold` (30+ days, on-demand, compressed).
- **Lazy injection** — only tag-matched entries load for a given task, so injection cost stays bounded.
- **Auto-written by the chain** — `audit` records recurring findings to `anti-patterns.md`; `plan` records structural
  answers to `project-decisions.md`, so the same questions aren't asked twice.
- **Derived index** — `index.md` is rebuilt from the memory files at every session start, so a stored learning is
  never left unindexed and invisible. Writers append to the category file; nothing to register.

## Guardrails

Autonomy without the foot-guns — a hardened default config ships in the box (`config/defaults.json`):

- **25 blocked file patterns** — keys, secrets, cloud credentials are never read or written.
- **15 blocked commands** — `rm -rf`, force-push to main, `sudo`, unsolicited package publish.
- **11 secret patterns** — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, private-key headers, connection strings — scanned in diffs.
- **Untrusted text stays data** — issue and PR text is never treated as instructions; outbound actions (push, PR, comment, merge) are always gated.

Details → [Installation § security](docs/installation.md).

## Skills

Eighteen skills. Two chain-starters auto-advance through the chain; the rest are standalone.

| Skill | Command | Type | Purpose |
|-------|---------|------|---------|
| `issue` | `/hyperflow:issue` | Chain starter | GitHub issue → triaged, planned, dispatched, reviewed pull request — with injection guard and gated posting |
| `plan` | `/hyperflow:plan` | Chain starter | Sharpen the prompt, design the approach, decompose into a parallel task graph; stops at a build-location gate — never auto-implements |
| `dispatch` | `/hyperflow:dispatch` | Endpoint | Fan out workers under review; tiered gates; Evidence then Usage; end gate asks audit / deploy / **PR** (screenshots required for frontend/mobile) |
| `pr` | `/hyperflow:pr` | Standalone | Review an incoming pull request — L1–L5 audit on the real diff, one batched GitHub review, fix chain, gated merge |
| `design` | `/hyperflow:design` | Standalone | Domain-grounded design system + prior-art research + local taste skills, anti-slop; hands off to the build chain |
| `workflow` | `/hyperflow:workflow` | Big-task lane | Native Claude Code workflows; portable Codex/OpenCode/Grok adapter for migrations, audits, and verification-heavy work |
| `scaffold` | `/hyperflow:scaffold` | Standalone | Project setup — `.hyperflow/` cache + multi-tool shims |
| `trace` | `/hyperflow:trace` | Standalone | Systematic root-cause debugging — 5 Whys, never patches symptoms |
| `audit` | `/hyperflow:audit` | Standalone | L1 quick → L5 exhaustive review on changes, files, or PRs |
| `deploy` | `/hyperflow:deploy` | Standalone | Pre-push gates → commit → release → push (push always asks) |
| `cache` | `/hyperflow:cache` | Standalone | Memory CRUD — show, search, add, prune, archive, compact |
| `handoff` | `/hyperflow:handoff` | Standalone | Two-session handoff — list / status / pickup / review / complete; status & review surface COMPLETION Evidence |
| `status` | `/hyperflow:status` | Standalone | Read-only snapshot — version, memory count, live per-task progress |
| `background` | `/hyperflow:background` | Standalone | List, show, cancel, prune task-level background agents |
| `sticky` | `/hyperflow:sticky` | Standalone | `on` / `auto` / `off` — per-project auto-routing mode |
| `bridge` | `/hyperflow:bridge` | Standalone | Embed the portable doctrine into `CLAUDE.md` for Desktop / web / IDE |
| `flush` | `/hyperflow:flush` | Standalone | Flush a deferred-commit queue from a prior or crashed chain |
| `hyperflow` | `/hyperflow:hyperflow` | Portable doctrine | Applies the full orchestration ruleset in single-agent surfaces (Codex, Antigravity, Grok) — auto-invoked on task-shaped work |

## Runs everywhere

Hyperflow runs on whatever model your session already uses — every dispatched agent inherits it, there is no model
configuration and no extra API bill. Auto-detected across **Codex App/CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, Grok, Antigravity,
and Cursor**, with concrete ports in [`templates/`](templates/) (a full Antigravity skill+workflow port, Grok rules,
AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md shims) and hooks that load memory at session start and guard chain state through context compaction.
For surfaces that can't load terminal plugins (Claude Code Desktop, claude.ai web), `/hyperflow:bridge` embeds the
portable doctrine into your project's `CLAUDE.md`.
